# Day 7: JavaScript: The Hard Parts, v2

## JavaScript principles:
When JavaScript code runs, it:
Goes through the code line-by-line and runs/ ’executes’ each line - known as the thread of execution
Saves ‘data’ like strings and arrays so we can use that data later - in its memory
We can even save code (‘functions’)

Functions Created to run the code of a function - has 2 parts
- Thread of execution
- Memory
  
Execution context
Code we save (‘define’) functions &
can use (call/invoke/execute/run)
later with the function’s name & ( )

###  Call Stack
call stack-> JavaScript keeps track of what function is currently running (where’s the thread of execution)
- Run a function - add to call stack
- Finish running the function - JS removes it from call stack
- Whatever is top of the call stack that’s the function we’re currently running
