# Day 11: JavaScript: Deep Javascript foundations, V3

### Introduction
Whenever there's a divergence
between what your brain thinks
is happening, and what the
computer does, that's where
bugs enter the code.

```javascript
// ex
let x = 2;
++x;  // 3
// this means 
x = x +1

let x = "2"
++x; // shoudl be 21
// but it's 3 beacuse JS is written like this
```
